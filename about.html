            <p>Content on the web is in constant flux: rapidly appearing, updating, and disappearing. However, many of these intentionally time-limited, spontaneous, or ephemeral cultural artifacts may hold enduring value and relevance to the historical record. As the web becomes the primary means of disseminating information, libraries and archives around the world are challenged with preserving this resource for current and future generations. As with all digital information, it is at-risk without active <a href="https://youtu.be/qEmmeFFafUs">digital preservation</a>.</p>


    <p>The <a href="https://archive.org/about">Internet Archive</a> has been leading the field of web archiving since 1996, developing the technical means to harvest, store, preserve, and access archived web content on a huge scale. In 2003 they helped form the <a href="http://netpreserve.org/about-us">International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC)</a> to support collaborative efforts to improve standards, tools, and best practices for web archiving.</p>

    <p>The UI Library Web History timeline features the major redesigns over the last two decades as captured by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970218140532/http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/">Internet Archive</a>, and was built using <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/">TimelineJS</a>. To provide authentic access to archived web content, the Wayback Machine renders the original functionality in the user's web browser with hyperlinks automatically redirected to archived sources rather than the live web.</p>
